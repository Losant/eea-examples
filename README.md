# EEA Examples

This repository contains reference implementations for the [Losant Embedded Edge Agent](https://docs.losant.com/edge-compute/embedded-edge-agent/overview/) (EEA).

These examples are meant to be used as a starting point and reference implementations for your own edge applications. They are not intended to function as out-of-the-box EEA implementations. Significant modifications will be required when implementing a production application based on these examples.

If you're new to the EEA, we recommend following the step-by-step [EEA Walkthrough](http://docs.losant.com/edge-compute/embedded-edge-agent/walkthrough/).
