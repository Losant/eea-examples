# EEA Example Application: ESP32

This folder contains an example ESP32 (C++) application for the [Losant Embedded Edge Agent](https://docs.losant.com/edge-compute/embedded-edge-agent/overview/) (EEA). The EEA works by compiling workflows to a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) module and publishing that module to your application over MQTT. Therefore, the majority of this code demonstrates how to load and interact with a WebAssembly (WASM) module using the imports and exports as defined in the [EEA API](http://docs.losant.com/edge-compute/embedded-edge-agent/agent-api/).

This example is meant to be used as a starting point and reference implementation for your own ESP32 applications. It is not intended to function as an out-of-the-box EEA implementation. Significant modifications will be required when implementing a production application.

This example is implemented using the [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/).

## Supported ESP32 Boards

Due to the memory requirements of the EEA (~2MB), only ESP32 boards with a PSRAM chip are supported. We recommend the [Espressif ESP32 WROVER KIT](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3384).

By default, this example does not fit in the ESP32's IRAM. Please refer to Espressif's documentation on [optimizing IRAM usage](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/performance/ram-usage.html#optimizing-iram-usage). The largest impact will be setting the compiler's optimization level to "Optimize for size" (-0s), which can be found in the `menuconfig` settings.

## Configuring WiFi

This example makes use of the [`example_connect()`](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/protocols) helper function to establish a WiFi connection. The WiFi SSID and password can be configured using `menuconfig` under the `Example Connection Configuration` section.

## Configuring the EEA

The source file `eea_config.h` contains a number of configuration options that change the behavior of this example code â€” the most important of which are the Losant device credentials, which are required when making an MQTT connection to Losant's broker.

## wasm3 WebAssembly Runtime

This example uses [wasm3](https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3) as the WebAssembly runtime. The build configuration of this project expects wasm3 to be in a `wasm3` folder at the same level as `main`.

```
$ cd eea-examples/esp32
$ git clone https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3.git
$ idf.py build
```

## Registered Functions

The majority of the code provided in this example applies to nearly any EEA implementation, except for the contents of `eea_registered_functions.h/cpp`.

[Registered Functions](https://docs.losant.com/edge-compute/embedded-edge-agent/agent-api/#registered-function-api) are the primary way your [Embedded Workflows](https://docs.losant.com/workflows/embedded-workflows/) interact with your application code and your device's system resources (e.g. GPIO, I2C, etc.).

This code provides an example registered function, `read_accelerometer`, so you can see how they are implemented and imported into the WASM bundle. It's unlikely that the registered function provided by this example code will apply to your use case. It is expected that you will remove the example registered functions and create your own.
